### 🚀 How to Deploy on Vercel

1. Push this folder to GitHub (create a new repo if not done yet)
2. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Import the repo
3. Wait for automatic build (Vercel uses Vite by default)
4. Add your custom domain (mydataguru.com) in Vercel project settings
5. Copy DNS records to GoDaddy → DNS → Add A record 76.76.21.21
6. Verify and your site will be live!
